Overview
--------

Upcoming.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for the ``SpikeTools`` module will be available `here <https://spiketools.github.io/>`_.

UPCOMING.

If you have a question about using SpikeTools that doesn't seem to be covered by the documentation, feel free to
open an `issue <https://github.com/spiketools/spiketools/issues>`_ and ask!

Dependencies
------------

`spiketools` is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.6 to run.

It has the following required dependencies:

- `numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_
- `scipy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_
- `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_

There are also optional dependencies, which are not required for model fitting itself, but offer extra functionality:

- `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_ is needed to run the test suite locally

We recommend using the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ distribution to manage these requirements.
