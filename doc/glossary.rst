A glossary of terms used in the module, with a description of how they are used, as well as common abbreviations.

General
-------

.. glossary::

    spike
        A term for an action potential from a single neuron.

    firing rate
        How fast an individual neuron is firing.

    fano factor
        A measure of the variability of unit firing.

    spike times
        A representation of spiking activity based on listing the times at which spikes occur.

    spike train
        A representation of spiking activity in which spikes are

    interspike interval (ISI)
        A measure of the time intervals between successive spikes.

    waveform
        The spike waveform is the shape of the action potential.

    raster
        A raster plot is a visualization of spike activity representing each spike as a vertical line.

    electrode
        A recording device (such as a micro-electrode or tetrode) used to collect the raw data.

    sampling rate
        The rate at which samples are collected for a recording device.

    spike sorting
        The process of identifying spikes and grouping them into clusters that represent putative single-neuron activity.

Units

.. glossary::

    Hertz (Hz)
        A unit of frequency, used to measure the number of spikes per second.
